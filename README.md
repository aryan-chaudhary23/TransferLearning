Here transfer learning is performed using keras with the help of VGG16
First transfer learning was done using the Feature Extraction method later when graphs were drawn it hinted towards overfitting
So to get rid of overfitting Data Augmentation was performed and we got rid of overfitting
Later code of transfer learning using Fine Tuning is provided
